# The New France Wine Company
I was approached by the New France Wine Company to redesign their website. This would includ a brand new, responsive customer facing site in addition to an admin management site where they can update events, wine suppliers and producers, and approve requests by customers to access pricing lists.

## Technology used
What I've used so far: React, Redux, Redux-Saga, JavaScript ES6, HTML5, CSS3, GeoDB API, Postgres, Node.js, Express, Passport, styled-components.

## Project Goals
This website is still in development. I intend to have an intuitive suite of tools for the business owners in addition to a responsive, modern website for customers to get an understanding of the personality of the New France Wine Company.
